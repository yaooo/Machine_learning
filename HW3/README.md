# Homework 3

## Objective 
[Build a FC layer‐based neural network to recognize hand‐written digits](https://github.com/yaooo/Machine_learning/blob/master/HW3/hw3.pdf)

## Prerequisites
Python 3 required.
Additional python pakages have to be installed based on the requirements.  
**Note: Tensorflow only supports up to python3.6 so far.**  

## Run the code
**Note: Because the weights are initialized randomly, the validation accuracy may vary repectively.**

To run the Tensorflow code:
```
python3 tensor_NN.py
```
To run the Numpy code:
```
python3 NN_relu_numpy.py
```
