# Machine Learning Project
## Prerequisites
Python 3 required.
Additional python pakages have to be installed based on the requirements.

## Run the code
To check the running history (or re-run the code):
```
cd <project directory>
jupyter notebook 
// Then click on the .ipynb files in the local server
```

To directly run .py code:
```
cd <project directory>
python <code>.py
```


## Dataset
1. https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells
2. https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset

## Code Description
* testing_model.py: <br>
Used to load the model, get the validation loss and validation accuracy for the testing and training dataset, and output the confusion matrix.

* testing_model.ipynb: <br>
Have the same code as "testing_model.py" but also shows the code running history.


## Model
* acc_95_83.h5---------->> 95% training accuracy, 83% validation accuracy
* acc_90_83.h5 --------->> 90% training accuracy, 83% validation accuracy
* acc_87_80.h5 --------->> 87% training accuracy, 80% validation accuracy
