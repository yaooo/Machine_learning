# Machine Learning Homework 4

## Objective 
[Build LeNet for colorful image classification (Refer to this PDF)](https://github.com/yaooo/Machine_learning/blob/master/HW4/hw4.pdf)

## Prerequisites
Python 3 required.
Additional python pakages have to be installed based on the requirements.

## Run the code
To check the running history:
```
cd to the project directory
jupyter notebook
```
Alternatively, to completely run the code once again:
```
cd to the project directory
python <code.py>
```

Code run on Jupyter notebook:
* hw4.ipynb---------------------------->> Network without dropout/batch normalization
* hw4_batch.ipynb --------------------->> Network with one additional batch normalization
* hw4_dropout.ipynb ------------------->> Network with one additional dropout

Code with .py (Python) format:
* hw4.py ------------------------------>> Network without dropout/batch normalization
* hw4_batch.py ------------------------>> Network with one additional batch normalization
* hw4_dropout.py ---------------------->> Network with one additional dropout
